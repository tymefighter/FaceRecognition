Building a simple face recognition program

This is open to all who can suggest improvements

- We have a file named 'face_recog.py' which contains the code for training the parameters
- 'encodings.py'-> contains the code to generate encodings using the already retrieved parameters
- 'face_conclusion.py' contains the code to predict the person
